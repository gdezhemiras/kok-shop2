* On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the-shopping-stop repository.
* Above the list of files, click on download Code.

* Open Git Bash.
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
* $ git clone ```https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/easy-buy```
* Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
* Open the terminal and inside the easy-buy directory perform ```npm install```.
* In second terminal traverse to ```easy-buy/functions``` and perform ```npm install```.
* Give ```npm start``` in first terminal and ```firebase emulators:start``` in second terminal.
* Boom ! ```localhost:3000``` has the working site. Keep the backend log open in ```localhost:4000```. (You can find the link from second terminal)
